# Multi-attribute-linear-hashing

My implementation of multiattribute linear hashing for DMBS. Linear hashed files and multi-attribute hashing are two techniques that can be used together to produce hashed files that grow as needed and which allow all attributes to contribute to the hash value of each tuple.

My implementation includes hashing, inserting, and selecting. My implementation also support overflow.
